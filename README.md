# ESP-IDF with Arduino Examples

![](/images/esp-idf-arduino.png)


ESP32 microcontroller program development with Arduino framework is fun.
Nevertheless, in order to be more flexible, it is often easier to go the route of ESP32 program development with ESP-IDF.

Say,
* With microphone module installed, it is possible to develop "wake-word" recognition; however, it is not clear / easy to do so in Arduino framework. E.g. [ESP-Box](https://github.com/espressif/esp-box).
* With camera module installed, it is possible to develop face recognition (not just face detection); however, it is not clear / easy to do so in Arduino framework. E.g. [ESP-Eye](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who).

Consequently, one might then choose to develop ESP32 program directly and completely with the well-supported ESP-IDF framework.

Nevertheless, it is possible to do it the other way around, by incorporating Arduino framework style in ESP-IDF programming.
Will this make ESP32 programming looks easier? Moreover, it might be possible to use libraries written using the Arduino framework.

As stated in [Arduino as an ESP-IDF component](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/en/esp-idf_component.rst)
> You can use the Arduino framework as an ESP-IDF component. This allows you to use the Arduino framework in your ESP-IDF projects with the full flexibility of the ESP-IDF.

It is yet to see how compatible is Arduino code with ESP-IDF code; regardless, let's have some fun trying some ESP-IDF with Arduino examples, as will be described next.

Here
* VSCode will be used as the development IDE, certainly, together with ESP-IDF VSCode extension
* The target [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) version is v5.3.2
* The target [Arduino core for ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) is v3.0.2


# Examples

The examples that we will try out are:
* [`idf-blink`](/examples/idf_blink/README.md): A simple ESP-IDF blink program that is basically generated by ESP-IDF without modification; it blinks the built-in LED (***pin 2***)
* [`idf_with_a_blink`](/examples/idf_with_a_blink/README.md): From an "empty" ESP-IDF program, modified to incorporate with Arduino to blink the built-in LED, the same as `idf-blink` but code in Arduino style
* [`s3_wb2812_blink`](/examples/s3_wb2812_blink/README.md): Again, starting from an "empty" ESP-IDF program, modified to incorporate with Arduino, in order to be able to use the Arduino library [Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32) for "blinking" the NeoPixel on an ESP32S2 board (***pin 48***)
* [`wifi_dd_blink`](/examples/wifi_dd_blink/README.md): Modified to incorporate with Arduino, in order to use the Arduino library [Arduino-DumbDisplay](https://github.com/trevorwslee/Arduino-DumbDisplay).
  With DumbDisplay, once can realize simple UI on your Android phone. You may want to refer to the post [Blink Test With Virtual Display, DumbDisplay](https://www.instructables.com/Blink-Test-With-Virtual-Display-DumbDisplay/) for a brief introduction to DumbDisplay. Note that this example `wifi_dd_blink` uses WiFi connectivity, rather than OTG as described in the post.
* [`le_dd_blink`](/examples/le_dd_blink/README.md): Like `wifi_dd_blink`, but is more extensive in using DumbDisplay's features, and is using Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. Moreover, `le_dd_blink` deliberately uses of some ESP-IDF constructs like `xTaskCreate()` / `vTaskDelay()` / `printf()`   


# Highlights


Again, using Arduino component in ESP-IDF is only supported with the corresponding ESP-IDF version. Here are the necessary changes:

* Add IDF component to `idf_component.yml`:
  ```
  dependencies:
    idf:
      version: '>=4.1.0'
    espressif/arduino-esp32: ^3.0.2
  ```

* The default of `CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ` in `sdkconfig` is 100, change it to 1000

* The entry entry point `app_main()` should be declared in a C++ file like
  ```
  #include "Arduino.h"
  extern "C" void app_main(void) {
      initArduino();
  }
  ```
  Notice:
  - The inclusion of the header file `Arduino.h`
  - The initialization routine `initArduino()` should be called the first thing in the entry point `app_main()`

* In order to make it more like programming with Arduino framework, `setup()` and `loop()` can be added like
  ```
  #include "Arduino.h"
  void setup() {}
  void loop() {}
  extern "C" void app_main(void) {
    initArduino();
    setup();
    while (1) {
      loop();
    }
  }
  ```

* ***A way*** to use Arduino library is to download the Arduino library source code and compile the library code as if it is part of the main program. Hence
  - in `main`, create the folder `arduino_libraries` for the the downloaded / cloned Arduino library source code
  - modify `CMakeLists.txt` in `main` to compile the library source, like
    ```
    idf_component_register(
        SRC_DIRS "." "arduino_libraries/Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32/src"
        INCLUDE_DIRS "arduino_libraries/Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32/src"
    )
    ```
    or
    ```
    idf_component_register(
        SRC_DIRS "." "arduino_libraries/Arduino-DumbDisplay"
        INCLUDE_DIRS "arduino_libraries/Arduino-DumbDisplay"
    )
    ```
